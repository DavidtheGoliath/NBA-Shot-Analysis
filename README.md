# NBA-Shot-Analysis
Flatiron School Final Project


# Goal
Explore NBA shot data using Python and Machine Learning to determine who the best shooters in the NBA are and see if I can accurately predict shot outcomes.

# Process
 - ETL
    - Sourced data from nba.com, basketball-reference.com, and nbasavant.com
    - Using data from the 2014-15 NBA season, consisting of 200,000+ shots
    - Feature engineering to add more context to each shot
 - Machine Learning Models
    - Use shallow learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to predict shot outcomes
    - Try to cluster similarly skilled shooters and recommend an optimal shooting lineup that covers each shot zone
 - Shot Visualizations
    - Using a combination of Plotly and d3, create a variety of shot charts such as hexbins, heatmaps, and more.
    - Do this for each individual player, team, and position grouping
